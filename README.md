## Problem Statement

The Stakeholders have requested the following Insights on the dashboard:

- Revenue trend by Day of the Week
- Orders and Quantities by Day of the week
- Quantity sold by Pizza size

## Data Sourcing

After effectively communicating with the Stakeholders to clearly understand their reporting requirements and expectations i went ahead to source for the data. internally.I then downloaded the excel file,extracting in to PowerBI for Cleaning, Modelling, Analysis and Visualization.

The downloaded Excel file is a structured data and made up of 4 tables (Sheets) as follows:

Table 1. ORDERS - With 21,351 rows and 4 Columns.
